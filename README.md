# Personal-Practice-Projects

Hello and welcome! 

HTML was used for structuring, CSS for styling, and JS for running a few functions!

Please see link to sample site here:
http://127.0.0.1:5500/Practice%20Project%20Building%20Website.html

For a smoother viewing experience, it's recommended that you open the code simultaneously alongside the site URL/link!

Happy coding/coding journey!
